## Sword and Sorcery

This game is a very early prototype of an idea for my Virtual World Design and Development course, made in Unity with Photon Unity Networking (PUN). The game currently only has two levels and a room must be created/joined in the lobby in order to play. 

Current Bugs:

* key acquired sfx does not play
* camera fix/instantiation of players

Future Improvements:

* door opened sfx
* ability to pull crate
* menu options (change volume, pause, quit game, etc.)
* more levels
* more mechanics for both characters
* music & sfx is placeholder
